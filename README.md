# d-latch-characterization
This repository contains the characterization of a CMOS D-Latch using SPICE simulations both pre and post layout. The project demonstrates latch behavior through circuit simulation and waveform analysis. Netlists, simulation setups, spice file, LTSPICE schematic using TSMC 180nm.
